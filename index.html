            <br>
            After graduating college, I became an art teacher and worked with beginners and
            professionals. I love art and my works have been featured in major art galleries
            accross the globe.<br><br> <!-- <br> were added for the appropriate spacing -->
            If you're looking to hire an artist or if you're an artist looking for a 
            collaboration for your next project, please reach out! I'm so excited to work
            with other artists to create new art.
